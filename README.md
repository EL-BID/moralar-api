# moralar-api

This is the server that provides access to all of Moralar Database.

### Moralar Project
Here are the repositories used in the project:

- Moralar App for end user - https://github.com/EL-BID/moralar-appusuario-flutter
- Morar App for Field Agent (TTS) - https://github.com/EL-BID/moralar-apptts-flutter
- Moralar Web App for Admins, Field Agents and Public managers - https://github.com/EL-BID/moralar-admin
- Web Server for All applications - https://github.com/EL-BID/moralar-api

  
## Requirements
- .NET 1.1
- A Mongo Database with SRV connection.

## Database

It's important that the Database has an admin user to be able to create all the entities using the Admin UI.

Make sure that the database has a Collection named UserAdministrator.

Create a document with this format:

```json
{
  "Name": "admin name",
  "Email": "admin@domain",
  "Level": 0,
  "TypeProfile": 2,
  "DataBlocked": null,
  "Created": timestamp,
  "LastUpdate": null,
  "Login": null,
  "Password": "admin-password-here"
}

```



## Setup
- Create a Mongo Database and paste on the `DATABASE.CONNECTIONSTRING` variable on `src\Moralar.WebApi\appsettings.${env}.json`, env meaning the environment you want to associate that Mongo connection.
  - That allows you to isolate Dev, QA and Production environment Databases.
- Update the packages with NuGet.

### appsettings

Update the following values with the ones of your deployment:

```
...
"DATABASE.CONNECTIONSTRING": "mongodb+srv://rest_of_url_of_your_mongo_database"
...
"Config.BaseUrl":"https://209-94-63-45.us-sjo1.upcloud.host/ApiMoralarDev/content/upload/"
"Config.DefaultUrl":"https://209-94-63-45.us-sjo1.upcloud.host/ApiMoralarDev/content/images/default.png"
"Config.CustomUrls": [
      "https://209-94-63-45.us-sjo1.upcloud.host/ApiMoralarDev/"
    ]
```

## Getting started

- In Visual Studio, run `IIS - Development`.
- The screen that will popup is the Swagger documentation, take a moment to check all endpoints and test them there, if you want.
- Is possible that, when loading the solution within Visual Studio, the module src/Molarar.Data is not loaded, manually add it.

## Deployment in IIS

- Before building, modify project file to include the following:

```
	<PropertyGroup>
		<PublishWithAspNetTargetManifest>false</PublishWithAspNetTargetManifest>
	</PropertyGroup>

	<PropertyGroup>
		<CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>true</CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>
	</PropertyGroup>
```

- Deployment was tested with a IIS Server v10

- Install SDK for .NET 1.1 from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/1.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/1.1)

- Application Pool

  * .NET CLR version: No Managed Code
  * Managred pipeline mode: Integrated

- Make sure that you that the folder inclueds a web config file for IIS, if not, create it. Below and example, but customize if needed:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <handlers>
      <add name="aspNetCore" path="*" verb="*" modules="AspNetCoreModule" resourceType="Unspecified" />
    </handlers>
    <aspNetCore processPath="dotnet" arguments=".\Moralar.WebApi.dll" stdoutLogEnabled="true" stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout">
	<environmentVariables>
    <environmentVariable name="ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT" value="Production" />
     </environmentVariables>
	</aspNetCore>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

- Create the following folders in the application root folder and make sure that the IIS_IUSRS has Write permissions.

    * ExportFiles
    * Content
    * Content/ExportFiles
    * Content/images
    * Content/upload
